CSS Grid
Overview
CSS Grid is a layout system for CSS that gives us a lot of control over the layout and arrangements of pages, and makes it easier to make complex layouts on different screen sizes and shapes.

It is a useful skill to be able to analyse a design or wireframe, dividing it up into a logical structure according to the relationships between elements. This is a skill that can be applied to many different kinds of systems.

Playing with CSS Grid
‚õ≥Ô∏è In a new index.html file, add a div with a class of container. Inside the container, add 3 divs with a class of box. Open the file in your browser and check the output.

<div class="container">
  <div class="box">Box 1</div>
  <div class="box">Box 2</div>
  <div class="box">Box 3</div>
</div>
 
‚õ≥Ô∏è Add the `display: grid;`` property to the container. This instantiates your grid.

.container {
  display: grid;
}

.box {
  background-color: red;
}
 
‚õ≥Ô∏è We can set the columns explicitly in our grid by using the grid-template-columns property. You can specify any number of "fractions" of the page to divide it into. Experiment and see what happens with different values.

.container {
  /* ... */
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}
 
‚õ≥Ô∏è You can use grid-gap to create a gap between the columns and rows in a grid.

.container {
  grid-gap: 10px;
}
 
‚õ≥Ô∏è Add two rows to your grid by adding three more boxes and using the grid-template-rows property:

<div class="container">
  <div class="box">Box 1</div>
  <div class="box">Box 2</div>
  <div class="box">Box 3</div>
  <div class="box">Box 4</div>
  <div class="box">Box 5</div>
  <div class="box">Box 6</div>
</div>
 
.container {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
}
 
.container {
  /* ... */
  grid-auto-rows: 100px;
  grid-auto-flow: column;
}
 
üéØ Build a grid of kittens using CSS grid. You can gather your own cat pics or use placekitten.com, it's up to you. Consider setting up some of the grid to be less uniform!

The Holy Grail Layout

üí≠ To make a header or footer span columns in a grid, grid-column-start and grid-column-end are useful! 1 is the first column, and -1 is the last column.
